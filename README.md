- [Traversy Media css grid course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo) - This crash course helped me understand css grid and how best I can work with it.
- [w3schools documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This is an article that also helped me in solving this challenge.
